### Text Editor

This is the test project from HelpJuice for front end developer position. The main motive of this project is to create a notion like editor with less complexity. If we start with /1 it need to show all the text as heading 1 block. If started with any other text or patten then the text should be normal after hitting Enter/Return keys.
